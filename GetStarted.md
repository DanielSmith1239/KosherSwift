There is still a small handfull of things I would like to add, but this library is definitely usable. I am in the process of implementing KosherSwift into my app, [YidKit](http://yidkit.com).

If you've got any enhancements to offer, bugs to fix, or general contributions, feel free to contact me with a pull request or an email.
