# KosherSwift
A Swift version of [KosherJava](https://github.com/KosherJava/zmanim).
Heavily referenced [KosherDart](https://github.com/yakir8/kosher_dart), which I also previously contributed to.

Also check out [KosherCocoa](https://github.com/MosheBerman/KosherCocoa) (an Objective C port) and the other [KosherSwift](https://github.com/Elyahu41/KosherSwift) that I didn't know existed when I created this.

# Documentation
A "Get Started" guide can be found [here](https://github.com/DanielSmith1239/KosherSwift/blob/master/GetStarted.md).

To view documentation, download KosherSwift, navigate to `Example > Pods > docs`, and open `index.html` in a web browser.

# Installation
Can be added with the new xcode package management thingy.

### Cocoapods
KosherSwift is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "KosherSwift"
```
